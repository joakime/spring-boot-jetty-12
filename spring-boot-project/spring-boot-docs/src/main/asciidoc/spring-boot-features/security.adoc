[[boot-features-security]]
== Security
If {spring-security}[Spring Security] is on the classpath, then web applications are secured by default.
Spring Boot relies on Spring Securityâ€™s content-negotiation strategy to determine whether to use `httpBasic` or `formLogin`.
To add method-level security to a web application, you can also add `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` with your desired settings.
Additional information can be found in the {spring-security-docs}#jc-method[Spring Security Reference Guide].

The default `UserDetailsService` has a single user.
The user name is `user`, and the password is random and is printed at INFO level when the application starts, as shown in the following example:

[indent=0]
----
	Using generated security password: 78fa095d-3f4c-48b1-ad50-e24c31d5cf35
----

NOTE: If you fine-tune your logging configuration, ensure that the `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security` category is set to log `INFO`-level messages.
Otherwise, the default password is not printed.

You can change the username and password by providing a `spring.security.user.name` and `spring.security.user.password`.

The basic features you get by default in a web application are:

* A `UserDetailsService` (or `ReactiveUserDetailsService` in case of a WebFlux application) bean with in-memory store and a single user with a generated password (see {spring-boot-module-api}/autoconfigure/security/SecurityProperties.User.html[`SecurityProperties.User`] for the properties of the user).
* Form-based login or HTTP Basic security (depending on the `Accept` header in the request) for the entire application (including actuator endpoints if actuator is on the classpath).
* A `DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher` for publishing authentication events.

You can provide a different `AuthenticationEventPublisher` by adding a bean for it.



[[boot-features-security-mvc]]
=== MVC Security
The default security configuration is implemented in `SecurityAutoConfiguration` and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration`.
`SecurityAutoConfiguration` imports `SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration` for web security and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration` configures authentication, which is also relevant in non-web applications.
To switch off the default web application security configuration completely, you can add a bean of type `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` (doing so does not disable the `UserDetailsService` configuration or Actuator's security).

To also switch off the `UserDetailsService` configuration, you can add a bean of type `UserDetailsService`, `AuthenticationProvider`, or `AuthenticationManager`.
There are several secure applications in the {spring-boot-code}/spring-boot-samples/[Spring Boot samples] to get you started with common use cases.

Access rules can be overridden by adding a custom `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources.
`EndpointRequest` can be used to create a `RequestMatcher` that is based on the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property.
`PathRequest` can be used to create a `RequestMatcher` for resources in commonly used locations.



[[boot-features-security-webflux]]
=== WebFlux Security
Similar to Spring MVC applications, you can secure your WebFlux applications by adding the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency.
The default security configuration is implemented in `ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration` and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration`.
`ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration` imports `WebFluxSecurityConfiguration` for web security and `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration` configures authentication, which is also relevant in non-web applications.
To switch off the default web application security configuration completely, you can add a bean of type `WebFilterChainProxy` (doing so does not disable the `UserDetailsService` configuration or Actuator's security).

To also switch off the `UserDetailsService` configuration, you can add a bean of type `ReactiveUserDetailsService` or `ReactiveAuthenticationManager`.

Access rules can be configured by adding a custom `SecurityWebFilterChain`.
Spring Boot provides convenience methods that can be used to override access rules for actuator endpoints and static resources.
`EndpointRequest` can be used to create a `ServerWebExchangeMatcher` that is based on the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property.

`PathRequest` can be used to create a `ServerWebExchangeMatcher` for resources in commonly used locations.

For example, you can customize your security configuration by adding something like:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{code-examples}/web/security/CustomWebFluxSecurityExample.java[tag=configuration]

[[boot-features-security-oauth2]]
=== OAuth2
https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth2] is a widely used authorization framework that is supported by Spring.



[[boot-features-security-oauth2-client]]
==== Client
If you have `spring-security-oauth2-client` on your classpath, you can take advantage of some auto-configuration to set up an OAuth2/Open ID Connect clients.
This configuration makes use of the properties under `OAuth2ClientProperties`.
The same properties are applicable to both servlet and reactive applications.

You can register multiple OAuth2 clients and providers under the `spring.security.oauth2.client` prefix, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-id=abcd
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-secret=password
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-name=Client for user scope
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.provider=my-oauth-provider
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.scope=user
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.redirect-uri=https://my-redirect-uri.com
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.client-authentication-method=basic
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-1.authorization-grant-type=authorization_code

	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-id=abcd
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-secret=password
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-name=Client for email scope
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.provider=my-oauth-provider
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.scope=email
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.redirect-uri=https://my-redirect-uri.com
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.client-authentication-method=basic
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client-2.authorization-grant-type=authorization_code

	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.authorization-uri=http://my-auth-server/oauth/authorize
	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.token-uri=http://my-auth-server/oauth/token
	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-info-uri=http://my-auth-server/userinfo
	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-info-authentication-method=header
	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.jwk-set-uri=http://my-auth-server/token_keys
	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.my-oauth-provider.user-name-attribute=name
----

For OpenID Connect providers that support https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID Connect discovery], the configuration can be further simplified.
The provider needs to be configured with an `issuer-uri` which is the URI that the it asserts as its Issuer Identifier.
For example, if the `issuer-uri` provided is "https://example.com", then an `OpenID Provider Configuration Request` will be made to "https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration".
The result is expected to be an `OpenID Provider Configuration Response`.
The following example shows how an OpenID Connect Provider can be configured with the `issuer-uri`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.oidc-provider.issuer-uri=https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/
----

By default, Spring Security's `OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter` only processes URLs matching `/login/oauth2/code/*`.
If you want to customize the `redirect-uri` to use a different pattern, you need to provide configuration to process that custom pattern.
For example, for servlet applications, you can add your own `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` that resembles the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class OAuth2LoginSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		http
			.authorizeRequests()
				.anyRequest().authenticated()
				.and()
			.oauth2Login()
				.redirectionEndpoint()
					.baseUri("/custom-callback");
	}
}
----



[[boot-features-security-oauth2-common-providers]]
===== OAuth2 client registration for common providers
For common OAuth2 and OpenID providers, including Google, Github, Facebook, and Okta, we provide a set of provider defaults (`google`, `github`, `facebook`, and `okta`, respectively).

If you do not need to customize these providers, you can set the `provider` attribute to the one for which you need to infer defaults.
Also, if the key for the client registration matches a default supported provider, Spring Boot infers that as well.

In other words, the two configurations in the following example use the Google provider:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client.client-id=abcd
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client.client-secret=password
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.my-client.provider=google

	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=abcd
	spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=password
----



[[boot-features-security-oauth2-server]]
==== Resource Server
If you have `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` on your classpath, Spring Boot can set up an OAuth2 Resource Server as long as a JWK Set URI or OIDC Issuer URI is specified, as shown in the following examples:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=https://example.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys
----

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/
----

The same properties are applicable for both servlet and reactive applications.

Alternatively, you can define your own `JwtDecoder` bean for servlet applications or a `ReactiveJwtDecoder` for reactive applications.



==== Authorization Server
Currently, Spring Security does not provide support for implementing an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server.
However, this functionality is available from the {spring-security-oauth2}[Spring Security OAuth] project, which will eventually be superseded by Spring Security completely.
Until then, you can use the `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure` module to easily set up an OAuth 2.0 authorization server; see its https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-oauth2-boot[documentation] for instructions.



[[boot-features-security-actuator]]
=== Actuator Security
For security purposes, all actuators other than `/health` and `/info` are disabled by default.
The `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` property can be used to enable the actuators.

If Spring Security is on the classpath and no other WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter is present, all actuators other than `/health` and `/info` are secured by Spring Boot auto-configuration.
If you define a custom `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, Spring Boot auto-configuration will back off and you will be in full control of actuator access rules.

NOTE: Before setting the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include`, ensure that the exposed actuators do not contain sensitive information and/or are secured by placing them behind a firewall or by something like Spring Security.



[[boot-features-security-csrf]]
==== Cross Site Request Forgery Protection
Since Spring Boot relies on Spring Security's defaults, CSRF protection is turned on by default.
This means that the actuator endpoints that require a `POST` (shutdown and loggers endpoints), `PUT` or `DELETE` will get a 403 forbidden error when the default security configuration is in use.

NOTE: We recommend disabling CSRF protection completely only if you are creating a service that is used by non-browser clients.

Additional information about CSRF protection can be found in the {spring-security-docs}#csrf[Spring Security Reference Guide].
